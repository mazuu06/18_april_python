Question 1: Loops in python ?
A type of program flow in which a statement or number of statements repeat one or more times with repect to a special condition.
There are two types of loops in python :
	1) while loop
	2) for loop

Question 1: continue, break and pass statements in loops ?
A type of statement that we use in loops when we want to skip one or more iterations with respect to condition.
A type of statement that we use in loops when we want to exit from loop on the bases of a condition.
A type of statement that we use in functions loops and conditional statements for leaving empty a loop,function or if-else.

Question 1: Looping technique in python ?
There are different looping techniques in python like enumerate(), zip(), iteritem(), items(), sorted(), reversed().

Question 1: Range vs xrange on python ?
Range function is use in python iterate a specific number of times in for loop.
Range and xrange are almost same but xrange only use in python 2.x. We can't use xrange in python 3.x. 

Question 1: Programs for printing pyramid technique in python ?
For printing pyramid in python we use nested for loop outer loop for rows and inner loop for columns. We can print numbers, charecters, symbols etc using this method.

Question 1: Chaining comparison in python ?
Checking more then two conditions in python. For Example :  a > b == c "is equal to" a > b and b == c

Question 1: else with for loop ?
We can use else with for loop. When we use else with for loop this else will only execute when loop complete without break statement inside for loop.

Question 1: switch function in python ?
There is no switch case statement in python like other programming languages. But we can use if-else, Dictionary Mapping, functions and classes in place switch case in python.

Question 1: Using iteration in python effectively ?
If we want to use iterations in python effectively we use some functions in place of range function in for loop.
For Example:
	1) enumerate()
	2) zip()
	3) items()
	4) sorted()
	5) reversed()

Question 1: Python Itertools ?
Itertools is a module in python that provides us multiple function to works on iterators. It is useful for complex iterations
There are three types of iterations in itertools module.
	1) Infinite iterators
	2) Combinatoric iterators
	3) Terminating iterators

Question 1: Python iter() and next() | Converting an object into an iterator ?
Python provides a bulitin method called iter() that is similar to loops. By using __iter__() method we access diffrent elemets from list, tuple, dic or set etc.A __next__() is use for return next iteration.It is more flexible and time saving then loops.

Question 1: Python | Difference between iterable and iterator ?
Every object in python that we can loop over is an iterable. It return a iterator when is pass through iter() function
Itrator only provide one next element from iterable. We use next() method to take next element from iterable.

Question 1: Generators in python ?
A generator functions work like an iterator.It is created on the fly it take less memory. It is more flexible over loops because it does not generate results every time. A special keyword use in generator function that is yield. Yield is similar to return keyword use in functions that return a value. Yield return a value and pause it next time is resume it and return next value.

Question 1: Generators expression in python ?
a = (x**2 for x in my_list)   ====> This type of expression is called generator expression. This expression return squre of each element of list.
